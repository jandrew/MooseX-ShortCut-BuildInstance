=head1 MooseX::ShortCut::BuildInstance

A shortcut to build Moose instances

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is used to compose Moose instances on the fly.

=head1 Methods

=head2 Exported Methods

=head3 build_instance( %args|\%args )

B< Definition: > This method is used to create a Moose instance on the fly.  
I<It assumes that you do not have the class pre-built and will look for the 
needed information to compose a new class as well.>  Basically this passes the 
%args intact to build_class and then runs 
$returned_class_name - > new( %remaining_args );

B< Accepts: > a hash or hashref of arguments.  They must include the 
necessary information to build a class.  I<(if you already have a class just 
call $class -> > I<new(); instead of this method!)> This hashref can also 
contain any attribute settings for the instance as well.


B< Returns: > This will return a blessed instance of your new class with 
the passed attributes set.

=head3 build_class( %args|\%args )

B< Definition: > This method is used to compose a Moose class on the fly.  
By itself it is redundant to the L<Moose::Meta::Class> - > class(%args) method.  
The use of this method is best when paired with build_instance.  This function takes the passed arguments and strips out three potential key value pairs.  It 
then uses the L<Moose::Meta::Class> module to build a new composed class.  The 
one additional value here is that most key value pairs are optional!  The caveat 
being that some functionality must be passed either through a role or a class.  
This function will handle any other missing key/value pairs not passed.

B< Accepts: > a hash or hashref of arguments.  The three key value pairs 
use are;

=over

B< package > - This is the name (a string) that the new instance of 
a this class is blessed under.  If this key is not provided the package 
will generate a generic name.

B< superclasses > - this is intentionally the same key from 
L<Moose::Meta::Class>.  It expects the same values. (Must be Moose classes)

B< roles > - this is intentionally the same key from L<Moose::Meta::Class>.  
It expects the same values. (Must be Moose roles)

=back

B< Returns: > This will check the caller and see if it wants an array or a 
scalar.  In array context it returns the new class name and a hash ref of the 
unused hash key - value pairs.  These are presumably the arguments for the 
instance.  If the requested return is a scalar it just returns the name of 
the newly created class.
