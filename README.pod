=head1 MooseX::ShortCut::BuildInstance

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a shortcut to build L<Moose> instances on the fly.

=head1 SYNOPSIS
    
	#!perl
	use Modern::Perl;

	package Mineral;
	use Moose;

	has 'type' =>( is => 'ro' );

	package Identity;
	use Moose::Role;

	has 'name' =>( is => 'ro' );

	use MooseX::ShortCut::BuildInstance qw( build_instance );
	use Test::More;
	use Test::Moose;

	my 	$paco = build_instance(
			package => 'Pet::Rock',
			superclasses =>['Mineral'],
			roles =>['Identity'],
			type => 'Quartz',
			name => 'Paco',
		);

	does_ok( $paco, 'Identity', 'Check that the ' . $paco->meta->name . 
		' has an -Identity-' );
	say 'My ' . $paco->meta->name . ' made from -' . $paco->type . '- (a ' .
		( join ', ', $paco->meta->superclasses ) . ') is called -' . 
		$paco->name . '-';
	done_testing();

=head1 Methods

=head2 Methods for Export

=head3 build_instance( %args|\%args )

=over

B<Definition:> This method is used to create a Moose instance on the fly.  
I<It assumes that you do not have the class pre-built and will look for the 
needed information to compose a new class as well.>  Basically this passes the 
%args intact to B<build_class> and then runs $returned_class_name->new( %remaining_args );

B<Accepts:> a hash or hashref of arguments.  They must include the 
necessary information to build a class.  I<(if you already have a class just 
call $class-E<gt>new(); instead of this method!)> This hashref can also 
contain any attribute settings for the instance as well.


B<Returns:> This will return a blessed instance of your new class with 
the passed attributes set.

=back

=head3 build_class( %args|\%args )

=over

B<Definition:> This method is used to compose a Moose class on the fly.  
By itself it is redundant to the L<Moose::Meta::Class>->class(%args) method.  
The use of this method is best when paired with 
B<build_instance>.  This function takes the passed arguments and strips out three potential key value pairs.  It then uses the L<Moose::Meta::Class> module to build a new composed class.  The one additional value here is that most key value pairs are optional!  The caveat being that some instance functionality must be passed either through a role or a class.  This function will handle any other missing key/value pairs not passed.

B<Accepts:> a hash or hashref of arguments.  I<These keys are always used 
to build the class.  They are never passed on to %remaining_args.>  The three key value pairs use are;

=over

B<package> - This is the name (a string) that the new instance of 
a this class is blessed under.  If this key is not provided the package 
will generate a generic name.

B<superclasses> - this is intentionally the same key from 
L<Moose::Meta::Class>.  It expects the same values. (Must be Moose classes)

B<roles> - this is intentionally the same key from L<Moose::Meta::Class>.  
It expects the same values. (Must be Moose roles)

=back

B<Returns:> This will check the caller and see if it wants an array or a 
scalar.  In array context it returns the new class name and a hash ref of the 
unused hash key - value pairs.  These are presumably the arguments for the 
instance.  If the requested return is a scalar it just returns the name of 
the newly created class.

=head1 Install from Source

(for example git)

=over

B<1.> Download a compressed file with the code
	
B<2.> Extract the code from the compressed file

B<3.> cd into the extracted directory

(For Windows find what version of make was used to compile your perl)

	perl  -V:make

Then

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
	make clean
